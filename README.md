# Project2-Group

We created a simple chat app built around rooms. Each room is focused around one of the 3 professional sports - MLB, NBA, or NFL - bringing sports fanatics into one space to talk about the latest games.

We hope in the future to expand to other sports, give more chat features, pull more information (team logos, player stats, etc) from the paid API version all to give a better sports experience. (Link: https://sleepy-dusk-14317.herokuapp.com/)

Please checkout our app on Heroku and let us know what you think.

Thanks from the team at The Chat - Dennis, Sam, Adrian, and Tony.
